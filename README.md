# Project-Images

A small image portfolio of some projects that I've created. All projects were independently coded or built by me, except for the tensile tester, which I created with a team of six other students during college.

Sublight Settings - 6DOF joystick configuration program

Tensile tester - a school capstone project that I led, built to automatically mechanically test material strain curves up to 1100 lbs of force

    <td><img src = "Tensile Tester B.jpg" width = 350></td>

Solar System Simulator - a hobby project that simulated the orbits of the 90 largest celestial bodies in the solar system according to gravitation attraction. The simulator includes the sun, planets, moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.
