# Project-Images

A small portfolio of some projects that I've created. All projects were independently coded or built by me, except for the tensile tester, which I created with a team of six other students during college.

Sublight Settings - 6DOF joystick configuration program

Elaborinth - a 3D game engine designed around portal physics

<table>
  <tr>

    <td><img src = "Elaborinth 2 B.png" width = 400></td>

Tensile tester - a school capstone project that I led, built to automatically mechanically test material strain curves up to 1100 lbs of force

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src = "Tensile Tester A.jpg" width = 350></td>
    <td><img src = "Tensile Tester B.jpg" width = 350></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Sudoku - a simple Sudoku game, with an automatic solver
